# NgHackernews

A Hackernews implementation with Angular.

## Initial note

This project starts off simple by just consuming the API provided by Y Combinator and Firebase that just display whatever data received.

A more advanced version will be requiring authentication and authorization for actions such as favourite, save etc, which will be done incrementally over the time.
