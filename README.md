# NgHackernews

A Hackernews implementation with Angular. The Hackernews API is used for this project. The project is currently still under development.

## UI Design

There was an abrupt rework on the design of the user interface. I felt the need to switch the UI because it was simply too terrible to look at now as it felt like everything was there just for the sake of being there, devoid of any effort and meaning.

On one fateful day, I stumbled upon [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) while reading some articles and it's unique and old school interface really caught my eyes. Intrigued and inspired, I decided to rework on the interface to look exactly like it, which in my opinion conveys better impression for a news website.

The screenshots of both before the rework will be provided once the project is completed and finalized.

## Features

The feature are pretty straightforward, its just a website that reads data from the API and displays them. To make the application more useful, an authentication was added via Firebase Auth and the user are able to mark any of the post as _favourite_ and _read later_.

## Checklist
